# Grid Layout Project

## About

This project aims to create an image layout using HTML and CSS.  The primary aim of the project was to learn about and practice using the CSS grid.

The layout structure uses CSS grid to position the images and responsive design to ensure that the images can be displayed at smaller resolutions clearly.
